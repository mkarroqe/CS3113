# Jumpin' George
In this game, I wanted to challenge myself to implement a sidescrolling effect both when the player moved and jumped. In this game, George (now decked out in cool sunglasses) has to work his way out of an underground maze full of evil AIs.

George is a peaceful boy, and is unarmed. To defeat the enemies, he must trick them into falling into holes. Despite living in an underground maze, they do not know how to jump or climb.

As George accends to the top of each level, the scenery changes from soil to rock and finally, to grass!
