# Instructions
Make a simple version of Lunar Lander:
- The player should fall with gravity (make it very low so it moves slowly). 
- Moving left and right should change acceleration instead of velocity. 
- If the player touches a wall/rock show text “Mission Failed” 
- If the player touches the platform show  text “Mission Successful” 
- You can use whatever graphics/theme as long as you meet the requirements.
