## Completed Tasks:
- Menu Screen: 
  - Name of game is displayed
  - `Enter` to start
- Moving AI Betta
  - Betta follows you unless you're near a plant
  - If you're near a plant, the betta swims away in the opposite direction
  - Betta slowly swims lower and lower until it hits the snail 
  
- Some way for player to win
  - Snail is moved "out" of tank when `y.pos > 2` (hold down `RSHIFT` for a few seconds to test)
  - `Win` screen
 - Some way for player to lose
  - Betta collision: life lost and level is restarted
  - after 3 lives are lost, `Lose` screen
- 1 looping background music
- 1 sound effect
  - Played when pressing `Enter` on `Menu` screen
  - Also played when betta and snail collide
- Implementation of original assets not used in previous assignments

## Future Development:
- Make gameplay last longer
- Set wall boundaries (maybe with more cubes?)
- More natural fish movements
  - making betta movements more realistic by rotating along y-axis
- Shorter load time in between scenes?

*Stay tuned!*
