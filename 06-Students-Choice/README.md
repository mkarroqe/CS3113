# Instructions
Make a game in the style of your choice (2D or 3D). No 2D Platformers or extensions of the previous project. If you are making a 2D game it needs to be something other than a platformer. It can be a top down game for instance, or other style of 2D game. A 3D platformer is OK! You must use new assets (art, music, sound) for this project. No Good/Evil Professor Carmines. No using George or anything from the lectures.

### Requirements:
- Menu Screen: Show the name of the game. Press enter to start.
- About 2 Minutes of Gameplay. (can be 1 giant level, multiple levels, etc.)
- Some sort of moving AI
- Some way for the player to lose (touching an AI, falling off a ledge, running out of time).
- Some way for the player to win (killing all the AI, collecting all the coins, whatever you want).
- At least 1 looping background music, and at least 1 sound effect.
